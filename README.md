# METAFlux
## Capabilities
* Use genome scale metabolic model and FBA (Flux balance analysis) with gene expression to derive metabolic fluxes for 13,082 reactions for bulk and RNA-seq datasets
* Discover various modes of metabolic cooperation and competition in single-cell data
* Has the potential to improve the understanding of aberrant metabolism and serve as a preliminary source to investigate specific metabolic targets.
